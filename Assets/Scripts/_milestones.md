Week of 2020-12-21
1. camera follow
2. monsters design (start with 2 types, design first, controlled movement, some types move in groups)
3. scene transitions
3. monster generator, has to be after design 

4. 卡在data representation上了，再来一遍

4. road game generation
    - noise for distribution

5. road random generation
    - Bezier curve

6. Clean script design!

6. can there be singleton GameObject without ? Generate GameObject from non-gameobject script (current solution: use singleton)(can add generic class to Generatable, and add a factory class)?


I decided that I will focus on the world generation, particularly the road generation for now. After this big goal is achived, I will then tackle the monsters' design and group genertaion.
